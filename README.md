# EFFECTS

[View The Project Here](https://farrukh-ahm.github.io/effects/)

This project was created to practice and demonstrate several effects which can be implemented to a webpage using HTML and CSS primarily, and occasional JavaScript. Some of the effects are very rudimentary, only created to show some properties like box-shadow and basics of animation, while some are bit more advance.

The page is not customised for smaller screen size, like iPads and mobile phone screens. Again, this project contains the codes to make different effects work. The webpage can be made compatible for different screen sizes as needed.

Feel free to copy any of the codes you like and implement into your projects, just a credit would be appreciated. ;)
