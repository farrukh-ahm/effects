            <p>
                I need to do something; these doors are going to collapse at any moment, and I’ll be one of them. 
                The banging on the doors of the warehouse was growing louder. The large shutter convulsed under the pressure, the hinges about to give away. 
                I was trapped inside, the other door leading into the supermarket was also blocked by these Draugar. <br>
                I started looking around frantically. 
                There were just shelves after shelves, boxes scattered around on the floor. 
                We had been plundering this place for quite a while now, setting up our base a few kilometres from this place. We were nomads. 
                We had to be. The world wasn’t the same anymore. The civilisation was gone, replaced by chaos and draugar, walking corpses, literally. 
                A product of a new virus we didn’t know where it came from. Some speculated synthesised bio-weapon, some said organisms from outer space crashed into the earth via non-threatening meteorites, while some speculated it to be a way nature purifies and cleanses the earth. 
                Whatever it might be, those speculators and conspiracy theorists were long gone now, or rather one of them, leaving behind few of us to fend for ourselves.

            <p>
                “You are here finally, good. We have waited for you for ages, waited patiently in hell, waiting for this time. WAKE UP NOW…..”
                I opened my eyes in mind-numbing darkness. The back of my head throbbed with excruciating pain as I grumbled and fumbled to sit up, 
                I really need to stop losing consciousness all the time. I touched the back of my head and felt crust, dried blood, Ah, great.
                I tried to look around, rubbing my eyes attempting to flush out the darkness from it. 
                The room seemed huge, I could see a series of faint light on the other side like a bunch of candles burning. 
                However, the darkness was strange. It was almost engulfing whatever light the candles could provide, preventing it to reach far from the source. 
                I couldn’t figure out much around me, my eyes couldn’t adjust to the vast gaping blackness surrounding me. 
                I struggled back to my feet, battling the blinding pain at the back of my head. I’m going to hurt you so bad for this Jav. 
                But first, I need to find a way out of here, wherever this is.

                I opened my eyes as faint light filled up the room. I sat up in my bed, not knowing how I ended up in there. 
                My dream was still fresh in my mind, the scent in the air, that mighty tree, that face beaming underneath. Sarah, I whispered.
                “Ah, you are awake!” I was startled by the voice in my room as I suddenly turned towards the dressing table to the left side of my bed. 
                The landlord was standing next to it.
                “Sorry if I woke you up, I just brought your breakfast,” he said as he placed down the plate. 
                There was a cup of tea and something which looked like sandwiches.
                “What happened?” He asked me calmly, walking closer to the bed.
                “What do you mean?” I asked back, although I knew what he wanted to know.
                “Last night? You were unconscious when we found you. What happened?”
                “Nothing really. Bad dream, I guess.” I said, trying to shut him off. 
                It was all too much to take and I didn’t want anyone to think I was losing my mind.

            <p>
                I was standing in a vast empty field. The warm, gentle spring sun was bright in the sky, a cool breeze rustled through my clothes. 
                I could feel the grass under my bare feet, scent of distant flower drifted in the air. I didn’t know where I was, still, everything felt like home. 
                There was a cathartic calmness all around, a sense of comfort and ease. I turned around to see a humongous tree in the middle of the field. 
                It was a sight to behold, something I had only imagined. The thing was tall and dense, its branches grew tens of meters long in every direction. 
                The tree was majestic. I was still in awe of it when I saw a figure standing right under it. 
                Though I was far from the person or whatever it was, I could feel it gleaming dimly in the bright sun. 
                I started walking towards it, like a moth attracted to fire. 
                All the way my eyes kept darting between the majestic tree and the figure standing under it, and as I closed in, 
                I felt the beauty radiating from the person and I recognised her. The tree was majestic, but she was mightier and far more beautiful.
