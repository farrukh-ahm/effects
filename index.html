            <p>I need to do something; these doors are going to collapse at any moment, and I’ll be one of them. 
                The banging on the doors of the warehouse was growing louder. The large shutter convulsed under the pressure, the hinges about to give away. 
                I was trapped inside, the other door leading into the supermarket was also blocked by these Draugar. <br>
                I started looking around frantically. 
                There were just shelves after shelves, boxes scattered around on the floor. 
                We had been plundering this place for quite a while now, setting up our base a few kilometres from this place. We were nomads. 
                We had to be. The world wasn’t the same anymore. The civilisation was gone, replaced by chaos and draugar, walking corpses, literally. 
                A product of a new virus we didn’t know where it came from. Some speculated synthesised bio-weapon, some said organisms from outer space crashed into the earth via non-threatening meteorites, while some speculated it to be a way nature purifies and cleanses the earth. 
                Whatever it might be, those speculators and conspiracy theorists were long gone now, or rather one of them, leaving behind few of us to fend for ourselves.
